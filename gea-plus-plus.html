    <h5>Description of the project</h5>
    Magic: The Rendering is an AR application tool for players of the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering to enhance their user experience in different aspects related to trading. The problems we are addressing are of various nature. One of them is that Magic cards are published with translations in several languages and it may happen that players possess some cards in languages they don’t know. For this reason they are forced to remember the card’s information and properties since they cannot read the content of the card. We are providing a solution to that problem giving the user the possibility to overlap a translated version of a given card in languages not known by the user.
    <br>
    Another problem we are addressing is the difficulty in accessing the card’s value information when they meet which is crucial in a continuously changing market and metagame. Therefore we give the user the possibility to scan a card on the table and view all the related information that may be of interest, as for example its rarity, legality, type, set or pricing information.
    <br>
    In addition to that, another problem we want to address is the complexity in managing big collections of cards. If a user has a large amount of cards (average player can have around 3K) it is difficult to keep track of all the cards a (s)he has or how many times the user has it. For this reason we provide our users a virtual collection of their cards. This way they may simply scan a card to add it to the collection, where they may easily check if they possess it already and how many copies.
    <br>
    In relation to  the card information displayed, the decision of having a slider to display the toggle buttons was brought by the fact that the app is easily scalable to show more information relevant to users with card information available in our JSON file or from others API, not just the three items (price, type and set) we have implemented in our demo.
  <br>
    <h5>App structure at a glance:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Home</b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Scan for information</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Card info shows</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Price</li>
              <li>Type</li>
              <li>Set</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Language translation</b></li> When activated, the app will show an overlay a translated version card on top of the original one
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li><b>Manage user collection</b>
            <br>
            List all the cards the user has in their collection as well as how many copies they have
            <ul>
              <li><b>Add to collection</b></li> This functionality lets the user scan cards to add them to their collection showing how many copies of each card they have.
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
   <br>
    <h5>Main problems/challenges to solve in order to make it</h5>
    Quick card detection was one of the key aspects to consider at the beginning of the project. Our group has experimented with various technologies to find the best way to recognize cards. We tried using OCR technology but found that Vuforia worked better for our goals. One of the main problems we have encountered when developing the app has been the difficulty in working in non-optimal light conditions which posed a challenge when trying to identify cards. Moreover, not all our teammates possess real Magic cards, therefore we have used virtual versions to test the app. This has added a new level of complexity in recognizing cards.
    <br>
    Regarding other major difficulties we have found, we can mention the decision of building our Unity project as an Android app and testing it on the platform later on.
    Many decisions we have taken regarding data management had to be transposed to how Android allows data storage. We found ourselves below schedule and some features we wanted to implement had to be removed.
    <br>
    <h5>Programming Paradigm/Languages/Toolkits</h5>
    Our project is developed through Unity, with C# scripts.
    We opted for Vuforia. Vuforia is a SDK to implement the AR architecture and to manage databases with target resources.
